This project is for the Udacity Data Science course, using data provided by Airbnb.

This builds two linear models to compare and contrast with to see how well we can predict
prices for short term rentals in Boston and Seattle.

The data itself is not stored in the repo, but expected to be in a folder labeled "data", on
the top level of the repo. To get the data, check (here for Boston)[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/boston] and (here for Seattle)[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle/data].
