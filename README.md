This project is for the Udacity Data Science course, using data provided by Airbnb.

# Project Motiviation #

This builds two linear models to compare and contrast with.
We are interested in:
* How well can we predict the price of a short term rental?
* What are the major features contributing to variance in prices?
* What are the unique features in each city contributing to variance?
